            <p>
                Donate Now believes that unless members of the civil society are 
                involved proactively in the process <br> of development, sustainable change 
                will not happen. We encourage and invite individuals for volunteer <br> opportunities 
                and volunteer registration, to be an active part of our organization and share the
                same <br> vision and purpose.
                Volunteers are the backbone of our organization they not only carry the organization’s 
               <br> ideals within them, but also spread the message far and beyond, 
                sensitizing the society towards the cause. <br>
                Let's spread some smiles!</p>
